  description: 'I am currently a software developer based in Seattle, Washington. I come from a mixed background of ecological engineering, art/design, and outdoor adventure leadership; which have ultimately shaped how I view the world. Over the past couple years, since I graduated from University. I have been studying art and design specifically aimed towards the entertainment industry, while also working at a climbing gym as a routesetter. Both of these roles have helped me develop my ability to create engaging, immersive, social experiences for people. Creating these types of experiences for people is ultimately what I aim to do, and I believe that these past experiences will translate well to the tech industry. Outside of coding, I love to explore new landscapes, draw, and climb.',
